# hello-world
Repository for practicing GitHub Flow.

GitHub Docs is helping me learn how to use the "Flow" feature in GitHub, which is great! I've been excited to learn more about the coding world, but sometimes that can be difficult since so many people are trying to sell how-to, course, etc. I'm glad that resources like this can be available for free, especially for if someone (like myself) is just trying to get a feel for how different tools work and how it may help in the future. 

Rather than write about myself in here like it suggested in the Get Started > Hello World segment, I would rather put in a resource guide for myself (and others should they happen across and read this page!) on the different resources available for free or for a smaller fee. I'll try my best to indicate which are free and which are not!

***Beginner Project Ideas:***

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Dataset:** Choose a dataset from a public repository like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository and perform exploratory data analysis. Explore the data using summary statistics, data visualization techniques (scatter plots, histograms, etc.), and identify any interesting patterns or trends. 

**Predictive Modeling with a Simple Dataset:** Start with a dataset that contains features (attributes) and a target variable (what you want to predict). Build a simple predictive model using techniques like linear regression (for regression tasks) or logistic regression (for classification tasks). Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy. 

**Sentiment Analysis of Text Data:** Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of text data. For example, you could analyze movie reviews or tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 

**Image Classification with Deep Learning:** Explore image classification using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Start with a simple dataset like the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the digits. 

**Web Scraping and Data Collection:** Learn how to scrape data from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup (for Python). Choose a website with publicly available data (e.g., news articles, product information) and write a script to extract relevant information from web pages. 

**Interactive Data Visualization:** Create interactive data visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly. Experiment with different types of plots and customize them to convey insights effectively. 

**Build a Recommendation System:** Implement a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. Start with a small dataset (e.g., movie ratings) and use techniques like user-based or item-based collaborative filtering to recommend items to users. 

**Predictive Maintenance:** Explore the concept of predictive maintenance by analyzing sensor data from industrial equipment. Build a predictive model to predict equipment failures or maintenance needs based on historical sensor data. 

**Clustering Analysis:** Use clustering algorithms like K-means clustering to group similar data points together. Apply clustering to a dataset with unlabeled data and explore the underlying structure of the data. 

**Time Series Analysis:** Analyze time series data (e.g., stock prices, weather data) using techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, or ARIMA modeling. Forecast future values based on historical patterns in the data.
